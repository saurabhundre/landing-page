      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"><a class="py-2" name="what">Challenge</a></h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Our client, operating a smart card system that handles ticketing for seven regional transit companies, was grappling with the growing frustration of 50,000 daily passengers who faced difficulties adding money to their smart cards. Looking to make a paradigm shift in the user experience, they approached Luxoft to help create an account-based system with a revamped web experience and an enhanced mobile application. </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"><a class="py-2" name="where">Solution</a></h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We leveraged a human-centered design approach to develop a personalized, account-based experience across the new website and mobile app. Our strategy and design teams harnessed the power of motivational user experience concepts through focus groups, designing solutions that enhanced usability, accessibility, and seamless integration with existing ticketing systems. The development team faced the challenge of operating within a complex multi-vendor ecosystem to “construct the mobile app, middleware and UI design for infrastructure pieces”.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"><a class="py-2" name="why">Result</a></h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Our client now has a secure and intuitive product that not only delights customers but also satisfies the needs of all stakeholders involved. The project served multiple transit systems while addressing customers' needs and supporting our client's business objectives. The novel website and mobile application, which covered an entire range of transit services, have been welcomed with open arms by users, as evidenced by their glowing feedback. </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"><a class="py-2" name="why">Objectives and Key Results</a></h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Our goal was to prioritize the user needs while integrating multiple systems in a customer-focused manner. The human-centered approach, identifying user experiences, understanding elements of delight, and integrating multiple systems, led to the successful development of the new website and mobile app. </p>

       <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"><a class="py-2" name="why">Project Outcomes:  </a></h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The product seamlessly reached over 5 million customer accounts  
	More than 50,000 daily users are catered to across seven municipal & regional transport systems  
	The newly launched mobile app received 4-star ratings on both the App Store & Google Play. </p>
	 <p class="mb-4">Our design elements sparked joy, elevating the task of adding money to the card from a boring necessity to an engaging experience. This design approach was tested and validated successfully. </p>
